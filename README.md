# Air-Quality-Monitoring-Using-ML


Air pollution is a very big issue in today's society. This project aims to leverage the use of machine learning to
predict the concentration of Particulate Matter (PM2.5) pollutant based on meteorological data and other pollutants' (PM10 and CO) concentration

##### Five pollutants were used in this analysis:
- Particulate Matter (PM2.5)
- Particulate Matter (PM10)
- Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)
- Ozone (O3)
- Carbon monoxide (CO)

##### Deliverables 
- Import Pollulants' Concentration Data for the Year 2022 + Data Cleaning 
- Analyze Evolution of Pollutants Concentration with Time
- Analyze Correlation Between Different Pollutants (to know which pollutants best explain PM2.5 concentration)
- Analyze Correlation Between Pollutants and Meteorological Data 
- Develop a Random Forest Model to Predict the PM2.5 Concentration Based on Meteorological Data and Other Pollutants Concentration
- Create an Air Quality Prediction Web App Using Streamlit
